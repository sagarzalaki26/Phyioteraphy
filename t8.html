                                and has proven benefits for recovering from illness and injuries. It can help alleviate

                                headaches, among many other conditions. The technique uses fine, disposable needles
                                inserted
                                into the body at specific points, which have been clinically proven effective in the
                                treatment of specific disorders. The Chinese have mapped these points over a period of
                                2000
                                years. Recently their location has been confirmed by electromagnetic research. Arthritis

                            <h4>Why am I suffering from arthritis? </h4>
                            <p class="mb-3">Osteoarthritis is the most prevalent arthritis and is often easy to
                                diagnose. An
                                acute joint injury might trigger it, or it can arise even after a previous injury has
                                healed
                                completely. For instance, suppose you were a college football player who sustained a
                                severe
                                knee injury. You seek treatment, rehabilitate, and reintroduce yourself to the game.
                                Although the injury is healed, damage to the cartilage and surrounding muscles occurred,
                                reducing joint support or slightly altering joint motion. As a result, it is still
                                possible
                                for you to get osteoarthritis later in life. </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">The same is true for occupations that require repetitive motions or overuse
                                which can be comprised under work injury for physiotherapy insurance. For instance, if
                                you
                                are a carpenter who is required to wield a hammer repeatedly as part of your employment,
                                you
                                may get osteoarthritis in the elbows or hands. </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">If you are overweight, you may also be at a greater risk of getting
                                osteoarthritis, as your knees and hip joints are put under more strain. </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">Rheumatoid arthritis is a different kind of arthritis that is less
                                well-known.
                                It develops as an autoimmune reaction, which means that your immune system perceives
                                your
                                joints as a threat and launches an attack on them. According to researchers, your
                                medical
                                history, environment, and hormones may all have a role in developing rheumatoid
                                arthritis.
                                Due to the disease’s autoimmune nature, it is normal for it to attack the same joints on
                                both sides of your body. Additionally, females are more likely to develop it than males.
                                You
                                can get Arthritis Pain Relief Physiotherapy Edmonton treatment from our registered,
                                skilled
                                and experienced therapists. </p>

                            <h4>What are the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis? </h4>
                            <p class="mb-3">According to the Arthritis Foundation, it is currently the largest cause of
                                disability. Arthritis causes pain and inflammation in the joints and can affect one or
                                more
                                joints simultaneously. </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">Because osteoarthritis is caused by the joint cartilage wearing down due to
                                age
                                or usage, joint pain is the most prevalent symptom, as the cartilage no longer acts as
                                the
                                thick cushion it once did. Without a cushion between the bones, the bones grind
                                together,
                                resulting in an inflammatory response in the joint. </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">Rheumatoid arthritis, often known as “inflammatory arthritis,” produces
                                joint
                                pain that is exacerbated by prolonged sitting, standing, or inactivity. </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">Arthritis discomfort can become significantly worse with movement, such as
                                knee
                                bending. With movement, you may detect popping or clicking sounds in the affected
                                joint(s),
                                as well as sensitivity or pain to the touch. Arthritis can also induce discomfort during
                                exercise or work, and the pain may subside after the action is ceased. </p>

                            <h4>How physiotherapy can help with arthritis pain: </h4>
                            <p class="mb-3">Often, our physiotherapy services enable our patients to avoid surgery,
